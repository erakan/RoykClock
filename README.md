## Description

![RoykClock](screen.png?raw=true "A desktop clock inspired from Royksopp's awarded Remind Me video.")

This is an app from 2003 that I created after watching the RÃ¶yksopp's Remind Me music video. This clock appears like 2 seconds on this video but I really liked it and want it. So here it is.  You can set alarms, change behaviour and look by using system tray menu. And there is a little suprise in the About menu ;)
